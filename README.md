# Web-Scraping


For first project i played around applying NLTK(NLP) methods and web scraping techniques in one go. You can scrape textual data from novels and plot interesting statistics like Word Frequency distribution, which gives insights about which words the author commonly uses.


For second project, i scrap popular job portal website and obtain information like the job industry, job location, type of job(remote, office, hybrid), expirience that you need, english level and etc. And then store all of this inforamtion in DataFrame for more convenient usage.
